## Installation

### Bare-metal (local machine)
- Prerequisites: Python 3.x, pip, Git
- Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/kokofixcomputers/1min-relay.git
- Install dependencies:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run:
  - python3 main.py
  Note: On some systems, you may need to use python instead of python3.

### Docker (recommended for ease of deployment)

Pre-built images
- Pull the image:
  - docker pull kokofixcomputers/1min-relay:latest
- Create a dedicated network (recommended for memcached communication):
  - docker network create 1min-relay-network
- Start Memcached:
  - docker run -d --name memcached --network 1min-relay-network memcached
- Run the 1min-relay container:
  - docker run -d --name 1min-relay-container --network 1min-relay-network -p 5001:5001 \
    -e SUBSET_OF_ONE_MIN_PERMITTED_MODELS="mistral-nemo,gpt-4o-mini,deepseek-chat" \
    -e PERMIT_MODELS_FROM_SUBSET_ONLY=True \
    kokofixcomputers/1min-relay:latest

Environment variables
- SUBSET_OF_ONE_MIN_PERMITTED_MODELS: Subset of 1min.ai models to expose. Default: mistral-nemo,gpt-4o,deepseek-chat.
- PERMIT_MODELS_FROM_SUBSET_ONLY: Restrict model usage to the specified subset. Set to True to enforce, False to allow all models supported by 1min.ai. Default: True.
- HOST: Host to expose HTTP server at. Default: '0.0.0.0'
- PORT: Port to expose HTTP server at. Default: 5001

Self-build (Docker image from source)
1) Build the Docker image:
   - docker build -t 1min-relay:latest .
2) Create a dedicated network:
   - docker network create 1min-relay-network
3) Run Memcached:
   - docker run -d --name memcached --network 1min-relay-network memcached
4) Run the 1min-relay container:
   - docker run -d --name 1min-relay-container --network 1min-relay-network -p 5001:5001 \
     -e SUBSET_OF_ONE_MIN_PERMITTED_MODELS="mistral-nemo,gpt-4o-mini,deepseek-chat" \
     -e PERMIT_MODELS_FROM_SUBSET_ONLY=True \
     1min-relay:latest

Notes
- The container port 5001 is exposed to the host for API access.
- When using Docker Compose, you can simplify networking and service orchestration (see repository for a provided compose file).

Verification
- Check container logs:
  - docker logs -f 1min-relay-container
- Test the API endpoint (example):
  - curl -X GET http://localhost:5001/v1/models
